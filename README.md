# Project – Booking System (Frontend)

## Project Origin and Context:
	•	Project retrieved from my github created with my student email account due to loss of access.
	•	Student Github url: https://github.com/s185736?tab=repositories.
	•	Originally completed as part of the course during the 1st semester of 2021.
	•	Re-uploaded to this GitHub repository for reference and portfolio purposes.
  
## Install React:
	1.	Open your terminal (e.g., PowerShell).
	2.	Create a new project folder: mkdir reactApp and navigate to it: cd reactApp.
	3.	Install React by running: create-react-app. This will install a tool that sets up everything needed to run a React.js application.
	4.	You can now start your new React app by running: npm start.

## Install Node.js:
	•	Download and install Node.js from: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Running the code:
	1.	Download the zip file.
	2.	Make sure you have an IDE that supports React (or follow the steps above to set up React).
	3.	Install Node.js if you haven’t already (see instructions above).
	4.	Unzip the file (you can open it in your IDE).
	5.	In the terminal, run: npm install.
	6.	Finally, start the app by running: npm start.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
